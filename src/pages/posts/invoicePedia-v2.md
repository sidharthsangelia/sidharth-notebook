# 🧾 InvoicePedia — From Plan to Progress

> “I had a vision. Then I sat down and built it.”

A while back, I shared a blog post about **InvoicePedia**, my full-stack invoice management project. In that post, I laid out some **next steps** I wanted to tackle to take the project to the next level. The plan was ambitious, but I was excited to make it real.

## 📅 Previously Planned Next Steps

Here's what I said I wanted to work on:

- ✅ Improve UI/UX with better layout and styling  
- ✅ Add PDF download/export for invoices  
- 🔄 Enable recurring invoice creation  
- 🔄 Build a better dashboard and analytics  
- ✅ Fix deployment and ship a live demo 🚀

## 💪 What I Actually Delivered

And here’s what I’ve **successfully shipped so far**:

### 🎨 Improved UI/UX  
I gave the entire app a **fresh, modern look** using **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components. The layout is now clean, responsive, and feels professional.

### 🌐 Live Demo is Live!  
I fixed all deployment issues and deployed the app on **Vercel**. It’s now available for anyone to try out:
