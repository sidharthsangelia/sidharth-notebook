There’s something about late nights that strips away performance.  
No one’s watching, no one’s asking, no one’s measuring.  

You stop being the “daytime you” and become the “actual you.”  
You remember the things you wanted to say all day but didn’t.  

Maybe we all need more moments like 1 AM, but in the daylight.
