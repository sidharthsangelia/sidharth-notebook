Have you ever looked at your bookmarks, saved playlists, or downloaded courses and realized: “Wow, I have **everything** I need, and still... I’m not using it”?

That’s exactly what hit me recently.

I’m lucky — I have access to one of the **best React.js courses out there** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. It’s a 71-hour powerhouse that goes deep into React fundamentals, advanced hooks, Context API, Redux, Next.js, TanStack Query, deployment strategies, and more. It’s structured, up-to-date, and full of hands-on practice. Yet here I was, having done **only 40% of it**, jumping from one random YouTube tutorial to another, searching for “better” content — as if I didn’t already have gold in my hands.

### Why Do We Do This?

I think it’s partly human nature. We’re always seeking shiny new things. But sometimes that curiosity turns into distraction. We undervalue what we already have, even if it’s exactly what we need.

In my case, the roadmap ahead is actually crystal clear:

- ✅ **React** (Maximilian’s course)
- ✅ **Backend** (Jonas Schmedtmann’s full-stack Node.js course)
- ✅ **React Native** (Again, a course by Maximilian)

Every resource is ready and waiting. No more searching. No more collecting. Just doing.

### What’s Been Holding Me Back?

One of the reasons I drift away is that **the projects in these courses often don’t have jaw-dropping UIs**. And I’ll be honest — I love beautiful UIs. I get excited when things *look* good. But what I need to remember is that **these not-so-fancy projects are teaching me the core skills that will eventually help me build apps that both work well and look great**.

Patience is key here. Fundamentals first. Fancy stuff can come later.

### My Promise to Myself

Right now, my university exams are around the corner. But once they’re done, I’m setting a new rule:

> No more skipping between tutorials. No more chasing aesthetics over substance. Just commit to the courses I have and give them my full attention.

- I’ll complete Maximilian’s React course — not just watch it, but **build** along with it.
- Then move to backend with Jonas.
- Then build mobile apps with React Native.

One step at a time. Complete, build, ship.

### Final Thoughts

This post isn’t just a reflection — it’s a checkpoint. A commitment. A reminder to **value what you have** before running after something else. The best resources in the world are useless if they sit unopened or half-finished.

So, if you’re reading this and nodding along — maybe it’s time you paused, looked at your stash of saved content, and actually *used it*.

Let’s stop consuming and start building.

See you on the other side — with deployed projects to show for it. 🚀
