Spent the whole afternoon thinking I found a deep framework bug.  
Turned outâ€¦ I just forgot a semicolon.  

Funny how code mirrors life:  
The problem feels massive until you zoom in enough to see the tiny, obvious thing you missed.  

Lesson: Next time I feel stuck, zoom in before spiraling out.
