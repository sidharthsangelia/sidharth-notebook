Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been working on a project called **InvoicePedia** ‚Äî a full-stack web app that lets users manage and send invoices both **personally** and through **organizations**, with the added bonus of enabling **Stripe payments**. It‚Äôs been a fantastic journey full of technical exploration and learning, especially as this was my **first time working with PostgreSQL** and **server-side rendering at scale using Next.js 15**.

In this post, I‚Äôll walk through what the app does, how I built it, and what challenges (including some deployment headaches!) I‚Äôve encountered along the way.

## üßæ What is InvoicePedia?

**InvoicePedia** is a modern invoicing platform where users can:
- Sign in using **Clerk**
- Create and manage invoices as a personal user
- Create and manage invoices within an organization
- Accept payments through **Stripe**
- View customer details and invoice history
- Get a simple, clean interface powered by **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui**

I intentionally kept the UI minimal in this version, as my primary goal was getting the **functionality right** ‚Äî but a UI/UX overhaul is definitely coming next.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Why I Chose It

| Tech            | Why I Used It                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Next.js 15**  | Modern full-stack React framework          |
| **Tailwind CSS**| Quick and responsive styling               |
| **shadcn/ui**   | Beautiful and accessible UI components     |
| **Clerk**       | Easy and secure user authentication        |
| **PostgreSQL**  | Strong relational database (my first time!)|
| **Drizzle ORM** | Type-safe queries with schema confidence   |
| **Stripe**      | Reliable payment gateway integration       |
| **Xata**        | Flexible cloud data layer (used selectively)|
| **Vercel**      | Seamless Next.js deployment                |

Working with this stack gave me a solid taste of how modern SaaS products are architected.

## üß† Learning PostgreSQL ‚Äî A Great but Tricky Ride

This project marked my **first experience with PostgreSQL** and let me tell you ‚Äî it was both rewarding and challenging.

Getting basic queries to work was simple enough, but writing **dynamic, relational joins with filters** took a bit of time and effort to get right. Drizzle ORM helped a lot by making things type-safe, but learning to think relationally (especially when combining personal and organizational invoice logic) was a key milestone in my growth.

---

## üí∏ Stripe Integration

Stripe integration was smoother than I expected. I used **Stripe Checkout** to keep things simple and secure. Users can generate invoices and then pay through a secure Stripe page ‚Äî a great way to simulate real-world invoice payments in a modern web product.

---

## üë• Personal vs Organization Accounts

One unique part of this app is how it handles **dual context**: users can either operate on their own or within an organization.

- If they‚Äôre acting as an **individual**, their invoices are tied to their user ID.
- If they belong to an **organization**, their invoices are scoped to that organization.

This separation allowed me to explore **multi-tenant database patterns** and how Clerk makes handling organizations easier through its API.

## üöß Current Roadblocks (Deployment üò§)

As of writing this post, I‚Äôm currently stuck on **deployment issues with Vercel**.

Even though everything works perfectly in development, my **`page.tsx` files are throwing type errors related to parameter types in dynamic routes**, which is currently preventing the production build from succeeding. I‚Äôm actively debugging this, and plan to resolve and deploy the live version soon.

---

## üé® What's Next?

Although the app is feature-complete, the current UI is quite **basic**. I focused on functionality over form ‚Äî but design definitely matters, and it‚Äôs high on my list of next improvements.

**Planned next steps:**
- Improve UI/UX with better layout and styling
- Add PDF download/export for invoices
- Enable recurring invoice creation
- Build a better dashboard and analytics
- Fix deployment and ship a live demo üöÄ

## üìö Final Thoughts

Building InvoicePedia has been one of the most **comprehensive learning projects** I‚Äôve taken on. From exploring backend data modeling with PostgreSQL, to user management with Clerk, and handling real money flow with Stripe ‚Äî every step taught me something new.

This is just the beginning of a bigger journey toward building real-world, production-level web apps. I‚Äôm excited to continue improving this project and share more updates along the way.

If you‚Äôre curious about the code, feel free to check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sidharthsangelia/invoicepedia) ‚Äî and if you‚Äôve faced similar deployment challenges with Next.js 15, I‚Äôd love to hear how you solved them!
