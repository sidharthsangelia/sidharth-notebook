Ever since I got into web dev, having a portfolio site felt like a proper milestone — a clean little corner of the internet to show off projects, talk tech, and quietly tell the world, *“Hey, I kinda know what I’m doing.”*

I built mine with **Next.js**, added a `/blog` with MDX, and it’s been nice.

But recently, I’ve been itching for something... else.

Not more features.  
More **freedom**. ✨

Freedom to write without the pressure of sounding smart or professional.  
Freedom to explore random ideas.  
Freedom to be blunt, messy, inconsistent — basically, *human*. 😅

## Why a personal blog? 📝

I think I just want a space that’s more *me*.  
Not just code. Not just React this or Tailwind that.

Like:
- Some days I’m reading city planning case studies comparing Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai.
- Other times, I’m binge-scrolling **Architectural Digest** just for the aesthetic. 🏛️
- I’ve been thinking about **minimalism**, trying to build good habits, or just rambling about how hard it is to stick to reading the newspaper daily. 😂
- I’m messing with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, **React Native**, maybe **Inngest**, and some AI stuff too.
- And sometimes... I just want to talk. Not code. Not tech. Just talk.

Trying to cram all of that into a “portfolio blog” feels off. Like wearing formals when you really want to be in PJs.

## So… why Astro? 🚀

Because it’s simple. Lightweight. Content-first.  
Exactly what I need for something that’s more about writing than performance benchmarks.

Plus, I’ve been curious about Astro for a while.  
This blog gives me a reason to finally dive into it — learn by building. No tutorials-only mode this time. Just build, break, fix, repeat. 🛠️

## Medium? Nah. 🙅‍♂️

I thought about Medium or other platforms. But:
- Half the stuff’s behind a paywall now.
- It just doesn’t feel like **mine**.

I want a home. A small corner of the web I control. Even if it’s just a subdomain on Vercel for now — it’ll still be **my** space. 💻

---

## What’s next?

I’ll watch a quick **Astro tutorial**, skim the docs, and start building.

This new blog will be more like a digital garden than a blog.  
No pressure to go viral. No SEO-perfect posts.  
Just vibes. 🌱

If you’re reading this on my portfolio blog — yep, that one stays. It’ll be all about projects, technical stuff, and the *developer* side of me.

But if you’re up for the unfiltered version — ramblings, reflections, experiments — stick around.  
That blog is coming soon.

Let’s see where it goes.

Till then, back to the dev tunnel 🧑‍💻✨
