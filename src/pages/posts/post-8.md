1 AM feels like the internet has gone to sleep.  
The notifications stop, the city noise fades, and even the algorithm takes a nap.  

It’s the only time when I feel my mind running without friction — no inputs, no comparisons, just me and my thoughts.  

I write, I delete, I stare into the dark until my own reflection stares back.  

Maybe clarity isn’t about knowing more.  
Maybe it’s about removing everything else until only the truth remains.
