    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-[color:var(--muted-foreground)] leading-relaxed">
      Hey, I’m <span class="font-semibold">{identity.firstName}</span> — a {identity.occupation} from {identity.country}.
      This site is my <span class="italic">digital notebook</span> where I share what’s on my mind —
      from tech experiments and cycling logs to social reflections and unfiltered late-night thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it as part personal journal, part small magazine — minimal in design, but hopefully rich in ideas.

    <!-- Personal Touch -->
    <h2 class="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold">Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me {identity.hobbies[0]}, enjoying a game of {identity.hobbies[1]},
      or {identity.hobbies[2]}. I believe in slow growth, meaningful work, and taking the time to understand
      things deeply.
    </p>

    <!-- Why This Blog -->
    <h2 class="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold">Why This Blog Exists</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted a space free from the noise of social media — no ads, no pop-ups, no endless notifications.
      Just words, ideas, and the occasional photo.  
      Here, I write to remember, to learn in public, and to connect with anyone curious enough to read.
    </p>


    <!-- Closing -->
    <p class="mt-12 text-sm text-[color:var(--muted-foreground)]">
      Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to wander — you might just find something worth your time.
